# GoogleHompage
my google hompage created with odin project
in retrospect i should have used relative mesurments rather than fixed ones 
understood the value of <path> i would love to learn to make things with path 
it was fun "hacking" with inspect panels you learn a lot about how the page was created, also realise how you should have gone about the page in the first place after the fact :p
yeah that all i have for now
